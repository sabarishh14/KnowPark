This project aims to develop a Parkinson's Disease Detection System leveraging AI
algorithms, specifically Genetic Algorithm and heuristic techniques. The system
takes audio files as input and extracts key acoustic features, including Mean Pitch,
Mean Intensity, F1, F2, and F3. Utilizing Genetic Algorithm-optimized heuristics
derived from a dataset, the system evaluates the extracted features to predict the
likelihood of Parkinson's disease, contributing to early diagnosis and improved
patient care.
